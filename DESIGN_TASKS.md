# UI Improvement Tasks

Based on recent design feedback, here are prioritized tasks for refreshing the application's look and feel and improving usability.

## High Priority
- **Establish visual hierarchy**
  - Adopt a modern sans–serif font (e.g., Inter or Roboto).
  - Increase spacing around calendar blocks and the side panel.
  - Replace hard borders with subtle shadows or contrasting backgrounds.
  - Introduce icons to represent work item categories.
  - Provide hover states on calendar blocks with quick actions (edit, duplicate, delete).
- **Revise color palette and layout**
  - Swap bright yellows/blues for muted or pastel tones.
  - Use CSS grid or flexbox for a responsive layout with consistent column alignment.

## Medium Priority
- **Improve work item panel**
  - Collapsible or modal-based filters with multi‑select dropdowns.
  - Live search that updates the list as the user types.
  - Group items by status with collapsible sections.
- **Submission workflow**
  - "Review Week" modal before time submission.
  - Progress bar hover details showing hour breakdown.
  - Confirmation toast after submission.

## Low Priority
- **Controls and settings**
  - Use a gear icon and modal for settings.
  - Sticky top bar for quick week selection and settings access.
  - Optional dark mode toggle.
  - Drag‑and‑drop calendar block rearranging and keyboard shortcuts.
  - Ensure layout adapts well on tablets.

These tasks can be implemented incrementally to modernize the interface and streamline user workflows.
